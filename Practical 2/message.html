      Dear Students! Welcome to the Hogwarts College of Witchcraft and Wizardry. This College, an institution of academic excellence and achievement, was established in 990 AD . It is the finest college  of magic for students.
      <br />
      <br />
      I want that our students should be imparted an all round education so that they become multidimensional rather than uni-dimensional. In my view, acquiring information is no longer the main focus of education; instead the main aim of education is to build the powers of human mind and spirit. We believe in providing our students an environment, rich in knowledge and supportive for their extra curricular interests.
      <br />
      <br />
      This college has given the highest number of wizards to the ministry, many of whom became the Minister of magic. Many students have made substantial contributions to the fields like healing, herbology, potions, etc.  I hope that all our students continue down the same path of success, while following the rules of course. I know that our college has a reputation for not being safe due to the past events, but I assure you that each and every student will be safe under my watchful eye, no one will get harmed outside of their own stupidity whatsoever.
      <br />
      <br />
      My best wishes to all the students of Hogwarts College.
      <br />
      <br />
     Professor Minerva McGonagall
